Linux is a family of free and open-source software operating systems based on **Linux kernel**.

 - **Linux kernel** was first released on Sept. 17th, 1991 by Linux Torvalds.

**Linux distributions** refers to _operating systems_ include Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries.

 - Popular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu, Red Hat, SUSE, and etc. **In this tutorial, we use Ubuntu. Other distributions might be not compatible with some example codes.**

Many bioinformatics software only works under Linux or Unix-like systems.

# Command line interface

Below is the initial command line interface of my Ubuntu. *It may vary according to your settings.*

```bash
~$ 
```

`$` is the prompt of the command line session, meaning that it is ready to get commands typed in.

Characters before `$` is the current directory. When starting a command line session, the default directory is `~`, your **home directory**.

- **Home directory `~`**: it also called a login **directory**, is the **directory** on Linux that serves as the repository for a **user's** personal files, directories and programs. It is also the **directory** that a **user** is first in after logging into the system. Usually, `~` is the wild card (symbol) of your home directory, and you can replace your home directory path with `~` in command line. 

## Command `pwd`

You can type commands after `$`, such as
```bash
~$ pwd
```

The command is submitted once you press ENTER key, and you will get the response:
```bash
~$ pwd
/home/cj
```

`/home/cj` is the output of `pwd` command. Can you guess what `pwd` does?

`pwd` prints your **p**resent **w**orking **d**irectory. 

> A directory/path is a hierarchical location for storing files on your computer.
> Folders are divided by forward slashs `/`, eg: `/home/cj` means folder `cj` is under `home`.

## Command `cd`

You can **c**hange **d**irectory by tying `cd`:
```bash
~$ cd
```

However, `cd` does not know what directory you want to enter, so it enters your home directory by **default**.

  > `cd ~/Downloads` is equivalent to `cd /home/cj/Downloads` if your user name is `cj`.

- **Default**: many programs have default settings. For example, when you open a website, your operating system will open it with the **default** browser. It is the same as Linux commands, commands make decisions for you if you do not tell them what you want.

Therefore, you have to hint `cd` what directory to go to. For example, go to the **root directory `/`**, and use `pwd` to check if directory is changed:

```bash
~$ cd /
/$ pwd
/
```

Now, you successfully go to another directory!

- **Root directory `/`**: the top level **directory** on Linux, i.e., the **directory** that contains all other **directories** and their subdirectories. System files are also under this directory!

## Command `ls`

`ls` is used for **l**i**s**ting files:

```bash
/$ ls
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  init  lib  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  snap  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
```

*Table. Important folders under the root directory `/`*

| Folder               | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/home`              | Users' [home directories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory), containing saved files, personal settings, etc. |
| `/bin` or `/usr/bin` | Essential executable (binary) applications.                  |
| `/lib` or `/usr/lib` | Library files required by executable applications.           |
| `/media` or `/mnt`   | Mount points for [removable media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removable_media) such as [CD-ROMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM) or USB drives. |
| `/root`              | [Home directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory) for the [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser) (super) user. |
| `/tmp`               | Temporary files. Often not preserved between system reboots, and may be severely size restricted. |

Like `cd`, you can append a directory to `ls`. For example, `ls ~` means listing the contents of your home folder.

```bash
/$ ls ~
Documents Downloads Games
```

If you want to know the details of your home directory, you can use the long format version of `ls` by adding `-l` to `ls`:

```bash
/$ ls -l ~
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 1 cj user 512 Feb 22 22:00 Documents
drwxr-xr-x 1 cj user 512 Apr 24  2018 Downloads
drwxrwxrwx 1 cj user 512 Feb 19 21:52 Games
```

| Column of `ls -l` |                                                              |

|                   | `d.........`: it is a **d**irectory.                         |
|                   | `-.........`: it is **not** a directory.                     |
|                   | `.rwx......`: is it **r**eadable/**w**ritable/**e**xecutable by the owner? |
|                   | `....rwx...`: **r**eadable/**w**ritable/**e**xecutable by the group |
|                   | `.......rwx`: **r**eadable/**w**ritable/**e**xecutable by all users |

- Words append to a command are called **arguments**, **parameters** or **options**.

- Arguments are separated by **blank space**. Be careful with a filename with spaces!

  > Three ways to handle blank spaces in arguments:
  >
  > 1. **Quote** the argument. Eg: `cd "folder with spaces"`, or `cd 'folder with spaces'`;
  > 2. Use **an escape character `\ `** before a space. (`\` invokes an alternative interpretation on the subsequent character.) Eg: `cd folder\ with\ spaces`.
  > 3. DO NOT CREATE PATH WITH SPACES!

## Command `mv` and `mkdir`

If you have a folder or file with blank in its name, you can use `mv` to **rename** it. For example, renaming `'zsh syntax highlighting'` to `zsh-syntax-highlighting`:

```bash
~$ mv 'zsh syntax highlighting' zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

> Same as:
>
> `mv "zsh syntax highlighting" zsh-syntax-highlighting`
>
> `mv zsh\ syntax\ highlighting zsh-syntax-highlighting`

Generally, `mv` means **m**o**v**ing files and folders to another destination, and renaming is just a creative usage of `mv`. 

For example, create a folder `software`  with `mkdir`, and then move `zsh-syntax-highlighting` to the new folder.

```bash
~$ mkdir software
~$ mv zsh-syntax-highlighting software
```

`mv` has another usage, which is equivalent:

```bash
~$ mv -t software zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

If you are confused why they are equivalent, let me introduce how arguments work in Linux system.

## Arguments

Although there is no gold standard for how programs parse arguments, basic commands have a conventional rule for arguments.

- Arguments can be categorised in **positional arguments** and **keyword arguments (options)**.

- **Positional arguments** are arguments specified on the command line, and argument position may affect how program behaves, for example:

  > `mkdir software`: *`software`* is the positional argument.
  >
  > `mv zsh-syntax-highlighting software`: *`zsh-syntax-highlighting`* and *`software`* are positional arguments, and their position affects how *`mv`* behaves.

- **Keyword arguments (options)**: are arguments with keywords, usually start with `-` or `--`, and may be followed by values. The position of different keyword arguments is not important to programs.

  > `ls -l usr`: *`-l`* is the keyword argument, meaning listing `usr` with details.
  >
  > `mv -t software zsh-syntax-highlighting`: *`-t software`* is the keyword argument and followed by value, meaning the **t**arget directory is *software*. 

- **More usages of arguments**: an example: below is a part of help page of `mv`. (NOT COMMANDS)

  > ```sh
  > Usage: mv [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
  >   or:  mv [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
  >   or:  mv [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...
  > Rename SOURCE to DEST, or move SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.
  > 
  >   -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY  move all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY
  >   -v, --verbose                     explain what is being done
  > ```

  Here, `mv` has two parameters (options): `-t` and `-v`.

  Several equivalent commands to move FILE to DIRECTORY verbosely:

  1. `mv --verbose FILE DIRECTORY`

  2. `mv -v        FILE DIRECTORY`

     > `--verbose` and `-v` are equivalent.

  3. `mv --verbose --target-directory=DIRECTORY FILE`

  4. `mv --verbose --target-directory DIRECTORY FILE`

     > `=` is used in long format keyword argument only and can be replaced by a space.

  5. `mv -v -t DIRECTORY FILE`

     > `-t` and `--target-directory` are equivalent.

  6. `mv -vt DIRECTORY FILE`

     > `-vt` is equivalent to `-v -t`.
     >
     > `-v` CANNOT be followed by values. Only the last argument (`t`) can accept values.

  7. `mv -vtDIRECTORY FILE`

     > The most concise version.
     >
     > `-v` CANNOT be followed by values. Only the last argument (`t`) can accept values. (Eg: you cannot use `mv -tvDIRECTORY FILE` or `mv -tDIRECTORYv FILE`)

  Below is the summary of those equivalent usages.

  | Keyword Argument  | Convention                                                   | Example                             |
  | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
  | `-k VALUE`        | `-` is followed by **one** letter, and it is the abbreviation version of keyword argument. | `mv -t DEST SOURCE`                 |
  | `--keyword VALUE` | `--`is followed by **words**, and it is more explicit.       | `mv --target-directory DEST SOURCE` |
  | `--keyword=VALUE` | The blank space in a keyword and its value can be replaced by `=`. It highlight the relation between a keyword and its value. | `mv --target-directory=DEST SOURCE` |
  | `-jk`             | Equivalent to `-j -k`, and `-j` cannot be followed by values. | `ls -lh`                            |
  | `-kVALUE`         | Equivalent to `-k VALUE`.                                    | `mv -tDEST SOURCE`                  |
  | `-jkVALUE`        | Equivalent to `-j -k VALUE`, and `-j` cannot be followed by values. | `mv -vtDEST SOURCE`                 |

- Usually, positional arguments should be in the last of command lines.

## Help page

There are several ways to print help page of a command. 

- Google it!

- `command --help` works for most GNU commands, such as `cat `, `ln`,  `cp`, `rm`. Have a try to print the help page of them.

  - ```sh
    % cat --help
    Usage: cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...
    Concatenate FILE(s) to standard output.
    
    With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
    
      -A, --show-all           equivalent to -vET
      -b, --number-nonblank    number nonempty output lines, overrides -n
      -e                       equivalent to -vE
      -E, --show-ends          display $ at end of each line
      -n, --number             number all output lines
      -s, --squeeze-blank      suppress repeated empty output lines
      -t                       equivalent to -vT
      -T, --show-tabs          display TAB characters as ^I
      -u                       (ignored)
      -v, --show-nonprinting   use ^ and M- notation, except for LFD and TAB
          --help     display this help and exit
          --version  output version information and exit
    
    Examples:
      cat f - g  Output f's contents, then standard input, then g's contents.
      cat        Copy standard input to standard output.
    ```

- `command -h` works for many user-installed commands, such as `python`, `R`, `java`.

  - Use ***Control + C*** to interrupt the running command.
  - Use ***Control + D*** to terminal the current process.

- `man command` will print the manual of command (if command has manual), such as `echo`.
> Try `echo -h`, `echo --help`, and `man echo`.

### Manual page

If you use `man command` without error, you will enter a new screen. On this screen, 

- Use arrows to move up and down.
- Type `q` to quit the screen.
- Type `h` to see the full help of screen control of manual page.
