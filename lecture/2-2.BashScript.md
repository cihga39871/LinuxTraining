## 2-2.1 What is Bash

**Bash** is a [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) and [command language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_language) written by [Brian Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fox_(computer_programmer)). First released in 1989, it has been used widely as the default [login](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login) shell for most [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) distributions and [Apple's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.) [macOS Mojave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Mojave) and earlier versions.

## 2-2.2 Variables

### Declaring variables

Variable declaration is a necessary part of any programming language. 

The name of a variable can contain only letters `[A-Za-z]`, numbers `[0-9]` or the underscore character `[_]`.

The following commands will declare a string variable named `soliloquy` with a particular value.  

```sh
soliloquy="To be, or not to be, that is the question."
```

- No white space between the variable name, `=`, and the value.
- No `$` before the variable name for declaration purposes.

### Accessing variables

```sh
echo $soliloquy                 # the easiest way
echo "$soliloquy"               # recommended
echo "${soliloquy}"             # recommended by Google
echo '${soliloquy}'             # the wrong way
```

- `$` is required.
- **PLEASE ALWAYS DOUBLE QUOTE A VARIABLE**.
- `${var}` is the complete syntax to call a variable.
- A string in single quotations `'` is parsed **as-is**.

Use double quotation mark `""` and brace `{}` to prevent from silly errors:

- A value in `""` is parsed as a whole when <u>white spaces</u> in the value.

  ```bash
  # create a file named "the file"
  touch "the file"
  
  # declare the variable
  new_file="the file"
  
  # failed to access the file
  ls $new_file
  
  # the correct way is
  ls "$new_file"
  ```

- `{}` assures the boundary of the variable name.

  ```bash
  # declare the variable
  filename_prefix="S01_12345"
  
  # try to create a file named "S01_12345_23456"
  touch "$filename_prefix_23456"
  # ↑ won't work
  
  # the correct way is
  touch "${filename_prefix}_23456"
  
  # or, it also works
  touch "$filename_prefix"_23456
  ```

Conclusion: **PLEASE ALWAYS DOUBLE QUOTE A VARIABLE**.

### Constant (read-only) variables

Shell provides a way to mark variables as read-only by using the `readonly` command. After a variable is marked read-only, its value cannot be changed.

```sh
FILENAME_PREFIX="S01_12345"
readonly FILENAME_PREFIX

# it fails:
FILENAME_PREFIX="S02_99999"
```

### Unsetting (deleting) variables

Unsetting or deleting a variable directs the shell to remove the variable from the list of variables that it tracks. Once you unset a variable, you cannot access the stored value in the variable.

```sh
filename_prefix="S01_12345"
unset filename_prefix

# it fails after unsetting:
echo "$filename_prefix"
```

## 2-2.3 Special and reserved variables

The following table shows a number of special variables that you can use in your shell scripts.

| Variable | Description                                                  |
| :------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  `"$0"`  | The filename of the current script.                          |
|  `"$n"`  | These variables correspond to the arguments with which a script was invoked. Here **n** is a positive decimal number corresponding to the position of an argument (the first argument is `"$1"`, the second argument is `"$1"`, and so on). |
|  `"$#"`  | The number of arguments supplied to a script.                |
|  `"$*"`  | <u>Combines</u> all the arguments into a single word, separating them with space. No argument provided will result in one empty string being passed on! If a script receives two arguments, `"$*"` is equivalent to `"$1 $2"`. |
|  `"$@"`  | All the arguments are individually double quoted. It retains arguments <u>as-is</u>. If a script receives two arguments, `"$@"` is equivalent to `"$1" "$2"`. Google: `"$@"` is right almost every time, and `"$*"` is wrong almost every time. |
|  `"$?"`  | The exit status of the last command executed.                |
|  `"$$"`  | The process number of the current shell. For shell scripts, this is the process ID under which they are executing. |
|  `"$!"`  | The process number of the last background command.           |

## 2-2.4 Variable features

### Wildcard characters

> http://tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/x11655.htm

#### ? (question mark)

this can represent any *single* character. If you specified something at the command line like "hd?" GNU/Linux would look for hda, hdb, hdc and every other letter/number between a-z, 0-9.

#### \* (asterisk)

this can represent any number of characters (including zero, in other words, zero or more characters). If you specified a "cd*" it would use "cda", "cdrom", "cdrecord" and *anything* that starts with “cd” also including “cd” itself. "m*l" could by mill, mull, ml, and anything that starts with an m and ends with an l.

#### [ ] (square brackets)

specifies a range. If you did m[a,o,u]m it can become: mam, mum, mom if you did: m[a-d]m it can become anything that starts and ends with m and has any character a to d inbetween. For example, these would work: mam, mbm, mcm, mdm. This kind of wildcard specifies an “or” relationship (you only need one to match).

#### { } (curly brackets)

terms are separated by commas and each term must be the name of something or a wildcard. This wildcard will copy anything that matches either wildcard(s), or exact name(s) (an “or” relationship, one or the other).

For example, this would be valid:

```
cp {*.doc,*.pdf} ~
```

This will copy anything ending with .doc or .pdf to the users home directory. Note that spaces are not allowed after the commas (or anywhere else).

#### [!]

This construct is similar to the [ ] construct, except rather than matching any characters inside the brackets, it'll match any character, as long as it is not listed between the [ and ]. This is a logical NOT. For example *rm myfile[!9]* will remove all myfiles* (ie. myfiles1, myfiles2 etc) but won't remove a file with the number 9 anywhere within it's name.

#### \ (backslash)

is used as an "escape" character, i.e. to protect a subsequent special character. Thus, "\\” searches for a backslash. Note you may need to use quotation marks and backslash(es).

### String manipulation

> https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/string-manipulation.html

#### ${string:position}

Extracts substring from `$string` at `$position`.

#### ${string:position:length}

Extracts `$length` characters of substring from `$string` at `$position`.

#### ${string#substring}

Deletes shortest match of `$substring` from *front* of `$string`.

#### ${string##substring}

Deletes longest match of `$substring` from *front* of `$string`.

#### ${string%substring}

Deletes shortest match of `$substring` from *back* of `$string`.

#### ${string%%substring}

Deletes longest match of `$substring` from *back* of `$string`.

#### ${string/substring/replacement}

Replace first *match* of `$substring` with `$replacement`.

#### ${string//substring/replacement}

Replace all matches of `$substring` with `$replacement`.

#### ${string/#substring/replacement}

If `$substring` matches *front* end of `$string`, substitute `$replacement` for `$substring`.

#### ${string/%substring/replacement}

If `$substring` matches *back* end of `$string`, substitute `$replacement` for `$substring`.

### Arithmetic expansion `$(( expr ))`

```julia
$((3+5*2**2))  => 23
$((6/7))       => 0
$((6/7.0))     => 0.8571428571428571
```

### Brace expansion `${from..to}`

> https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/bash-brace-expansion

Bash *brace expansion* is used to generate stings at the command line or in a shell script. The syntax for brace expansion consists of either a sequence specification or a comma separated list of items inside curly braces `{}`. A sequence consists of a starting and ending item separated by two periods `..`.

Some examples and what they expand to:

```julia
{aa,bb,cc,dd}  => aa bb cc dd
{0..12}        => 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
{3..-2}        => 3 2 1 0 -1 -2
{a..g}         => a b c d e f g
{g..a}         => g f e d c b a
```

If the brace expansion has a prefix or suffix string then those strings are included in the expansion:

```julia
a{0..3}b       => a0b a1b a2b a3b
```

Brace expansions can be nested:

```julia
{a,b{1..3},c}  => a b1 b2 b3 c
```

## 2-2.5 Input/Output (I/O), pipes and redirection

### I/O

INPUT → command → OUTPUT

Output includes standard output (STDOUT), and standard error (STDERR).

### Pipe

command A → STDOUT of A as INPUT of B → command B

In shell, `commandA | commandB`.

### Redirections

|Code|Description|
|- |- |
|`cmd1 | cmd2`|Pipe. The output of `cmd1` is passed as the input of `cmd2`|
|`> file` or `1> file`|Clear `file`, and redirect standard output to `file`|
|`2> file`|Clear `file`, and redirect standard error to `file`|
|`>> file`|Do not clear `file`, but append standard output to `file`|
| `2> /dev/null` | Redirect error output to `null`                            |
| `&> /dev/null` | Redirect both stdout and stderr to `null` |
| `>&2 echo 123` | Write `123` to stderr                                        |
| `2>&1 | less` | Add stderr to stdout and print it with less |
