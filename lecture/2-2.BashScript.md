## 2-2.1 What is Bash

**Bash** is a [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) and [command language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_language) written by [Brian Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fox_(computer_programmer)). First released in 1989, it has been used widely as the default [login](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login) shell for most [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) distributions and [Apple's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.) [macOS Mojave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Mojave) and earlier versions.

## 2-2.2 Variables

### Declaring variables

Variable declaration is a necessary part of any programming language. 

The name of a variable can contain only letters `[A-Za-z]`, numbers `[0-9]` or the underscore character `[_]`.

The following commands will declare a string variable named `soliloquy` with a particular value.  

```sh
soliloquy="To be, or not to be, that is the question."
```

- No whitespace between the variable name, `=`, and the value.
- No `$` before the variable name for declaration purposes.

### Accessing variables

```sh
echo $soliloquy                 # the easiest way
echo "$soliloquy"               # recommended
echo "${soliloquy}"             # recommended by Google
echo '${soliloquy}'             # the wrong way
```

- `$` is required.
- **PLEASE ALWAYS DOUBLE QUOTE A VARIABLE**.
- `${var}` is the complete syntax to call a variable.
- A string in single quotations `'` is parsed **as-is**.

Use double quotation mark `""` and brace `{}` to prevent from silly errors:

- A value in `""` is parsed as a whole when <u>white spaces</u> in the value.

  ```bash
  # create a file named "the file"
  touch "the file"
  
  # declare the variable
  new_file="the file"
  
  # failed to access the file
  ls $new_file
  
  # the correct way is
  ls "$new_file"
  ```

- `{}` assures the boundary of the variable name.

  ```bash
  # declare the variable
  filename_prefix="S01_12345"
  
  # try to create a file named "S01_12345_23456"
  touch "$filename_prefix_23456"
  # â†‘ won't work
  
  # the correct way is
  touch "${filename_prefix}_23456"
  
  # or, it also works
  touch "$filename_prefix"_23456
  ```

Conclusion: **PLEASE ALWAYS DOUBLE QUOTE A VARIABLE**.

### Constant (read-only) variables

Shell provides a way to mark variables as read-only by using the `readonly` command. After a variable is marked read-only, its value cannot be changed.

```sh
FILENAME_PREFIX="S01_12345"
readonly FILENAME_PREFIX

# it fails:
FILENAME_PREFIX="S02_99999"
```

### Unsetting (deleting) variables

Unsetting or deleting a variable directs the shell to remove the variable from the list of variables that it tracks. Once you unset a variable, you cannot access the stored value in the variable.

```sh
filename_prefix="S01_12345"
unset filename_prefix

# it fails after unsetting:
echo "$filename_prefix"
```

## 2-2.3 Special and reserved variables

The following table shows a number of special variables that you can use in your shell scripts.

| Variable | Description                                                  |
| :------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  `"$0"`  | The filename of the current script.                          |
|  `"$n"`  | These variables correspond to the arguments with which a script was invoked. Here **n** is a positive decimal number corresponding to the position of an argument (the first argument is `"$1"`, the second argument is `"$1"`, and so on). |
|  `"$#"`  | The number of arguments supplied to a script.                |
|  `"$*"`  | <u>Combines</u> all the arguments into a single word, separating them with space. No argument provided will result in one empty string being passed on! If a script receives two arguments, `"$*"` is equivalent to `"$1 $2"`. |
|  `"$@"`  | All the arguments are individually double quoted. It retains arguments <u>as-is</u>. If a script receives two arguments, `"$@"` is equivalent to `"$1" "$2"`. Google: `"$@"` is right almost every time, and `"$*"` is wrong almost every time. |
|  `"$?"`  | The exit status of the last command executed.                |
|  `"$$"`  | The process number of the current shell. For shell scripts, this is the process ID under which they are executing. |
|  `"$!"`  | The process number of the last background command.           |

### I/O

### Redirections

|Code|Description|
|- |- |
|`cmd1 | cmd2`|Pipe. The output of `cmd1` is passed as the input of `cmd2`|
|`> file` or `1> file`|Clear `file`, and redirect standard output to `file`|
|`2> file`|Clear `file`, and redirect standard error to `file`|
|`>> file`|Do not clear `file`, but append standard output to `file`|
| `2> /dev/null` | Redirect error output to `null`                            |
| `&> /dev/null` | Redirect both stdout and stderr to `null` |
| `>&2 echo 123` | Write `123` to stderr                                        |
| `2>&1 | less` | Add stderr to stdout and print it with less |
